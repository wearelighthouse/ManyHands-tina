      Jane kicked off the night with a talk about how to create an insights-led
      culture, and the importance of user-centricity throughout your
      organisation (not just in UX and product teams). \

      \

      Russ followed up with an interactive presentation on how to manipulate
      creativity, which involved handing out some strange nicknacks from charity
      shops and putting people on the spot to come up with best uses for them.
