      [Alexander Baxevanis](https://www.linkedin.com/in/futureshape/) inspired
      us to explore our creative potential, encouraging everyone to pursue side
      projects that ignite their passion.


      [Tom Shurrock](https://www.linkedin.com/in/shurrock/) gave us some
      much-needed real talk on how to succeed in product, bonding with us over
      the challenges of navigating the “dark swamp of despair” that many face
      along the way.
