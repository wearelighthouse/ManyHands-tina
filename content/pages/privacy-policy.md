      ### How we use cookies


      A cookie is a very small piece of data which lets a website remember you
      and your actions, once you’ve given it permission to do so.


      First party cookies are created, stored and used only by the website
      you’re visiting directly. They allow site owners to collect customer
      analytics data, remember language settings, and carry out other useful
      functions that help provide a good user experience. GA4 uses these first
      party cookies to track data anonymously and remain compliant with
      regulations like GDPR. They are not shared with other parties or websites.


      Third party cookies are generated and placed on the user’s device by a
      website other than the one the user is visiting. They’re created when a
      user visits a website that includes elements from other sites – for
      example, if there’s an embedded YouTube video on a website and it’s
      watched by the user, the YouTube server will set a cookie on the user’s
      device which could be used to suggest similar videos when they visit
      YouTube in the future.


      We currently do not use any third party cookies for advertising,
      retargeting or tracking purposes. The third party cookies we do use are
      either for necessary or functional purposes.

      ### Links to other websites


      Our website may contain links to other websites of interest. However, once
      you have used these links to leave our site, you should note that we do
      not have any control over that other website. Therefore, we cannot be
      responsible for the protection and privacy of any information which you
      provide whilst visiting such sites and such sites are not governed by this
      privacy statement. You should exercise caution and look at the privacy
      statement applicable to the website in question.
