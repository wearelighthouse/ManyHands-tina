        title: Data & Analytics Platform for TV Presenters
    _template: bigList
  - body: "With our creative brains all warmed up, we grabbed some pizza, got into groups, and started brainstorming. An hour later, we pitched our ideas back to the wider group:\n\n\U0001F94A Presenters are performers, and performers are competitive. Rivals.tv taps into that energy with a platform that helps presenters understand their audience, monitor the competition, and win the ratings game. From leaderboard-driven incentives to a “quirkimeter” for tone of voice, it even came with a clickable prototype. A well-deserved winner.\n\n\U0001FA84 Ever panicked mid-broadcast with nothing to say? Streamster ensures presenters never run out of ideas. It analyses trending content, social data, and comments to serve up ready-to-roll scripts and smart prompts. Built for internet streamers and TV personalities alike, it helps keep the spotlight on.\n\n\U0001F336️ Choosing the right guest can make or break a segment. Tasty Talent is a guest-suggestion tool that lets you dial up the drama or go full feel-good. Whether you're after a baddie with a tabloid past or a hero with a halo, it helps presenters build the perfect guest line-up.\n\n\U0001F3A5 With so much content out there, how do you make sure your documentary gets watched? Lean Filming uses A/B testing and social media insights to test early cuts and improve discoverability. Created with indie filmmakers in mind, it’s a data-driven approach to storytelling that meets audiences where they are.\n"
