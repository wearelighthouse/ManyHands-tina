      With our creative brains all warmed up, we grabbed some pizza, got into
      groups, and started brainstorming. An hour later, we pitched our ideas
      back to the wider group:

          I loved the layout of the whole event from beginning to end. 


          The two talks were very interesting, providing insight into both
          product management and the more personal, human aspect of people and
          products. I loved the challenge of grouping people into teams and
          needing to put together a presentation to implement our learnings. 


          I'd 100% come back and would recommend some colleagues join me too!
