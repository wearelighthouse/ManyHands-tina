      Evolving Leadership Expectations & Product Team Accountability


      • The challenge: Navigating evolving expectations across tech, product,
      and UX while establishing clear roles and accountability.


      • Takeaway: To ensure alignment, Both executives and individual
      contributors must understand overarching business objectives and their
      roles within them.

      Organizational Alignment & Change


      • The challenge: Shifting towards a more mature, product-led organization
      while embedding customer-centric thinking.


      • Takeaway: Achieving alignment requires a combination of top-down and
      bottom-up approaches, and that includes breaking it down into smaller,
      agile initiatives makes it more manageable.

      Speed vs. Quality Trade-Off


      • The challenge: Balancing the pressure to deliver quickly while
      maintaining quality and avoiding ineffective decision-making.


      • Takeaway: Speed and quality can coexist, but a clear definition of
      "quality" must exist within an organization.

          I really liked that it was held in the morning rather than the usual
          evening events. The roundtable format made for great conversations,
          allowing everyone to share their insights on the topic. Overall, I
          thought it was very well organized and engaging.

          The format of event was probably the best I've ever attended. A
          morning event was heaps more accessible to me than an evening one so I
          was genuinely excited to be able to finally attend something I'm
          interested in! I loved the topical discussion which enabled people to
          connect over a shared topic rather than to try to find each other
          through general networking. I enjoyed hearing from the people on my
          table. Joel Newman's talk was especially relevant as it validated a
          lot of what I'm doing and how I'm going about leading my user research
          department.
